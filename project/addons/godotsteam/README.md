Current Build
---
You can [download pre-compiled versions _(currently v4.5.2)_ of this repo here](https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam/releases).

**Version 4.5.2 Changes**
- Fixed: crashes on `generateItems`, `startPurchase`, and `exchangeItems`, thanks to _sepTN_

**Version 4.5.1 Changes**
- Fixed: app ID automatically being set to 480, now default is 0 which makes GodotSteam ignore auto-setting app ID

**Version 4.5 Changes**
- Added: two new arguments to `steamInit` and `steamInitEx` to set your app ID, thanks to _GreenFox_
- Added: two Music class callbacks
- Changed: `generateItems`, `exchangeItems`, `getItemsByID`, and `startPurchase` all list-based arguments are now PoolIntArrays
- Changed: `getItemsByID` now takes one argument, counts the elements in the passed array instead
- Changed: `getItemsWithPrices` no longer requires any arguments passed to it
- Changed: in-editor docs have been updated
- Fixed: `getResultItems` now returns all item data
- Fixed: missing DEFVAL for `steamInitEx`
- Fixed: Joy Con name in `getInputTypeForHandle`
- Removed: `getNumItemsWithPrices` as it was unnecessary

Known Issues
---
- GDExtension for 4.1 is **not** compatible with 4.0.3 or lower. Please check the versions you are using.
- Overlay will not work in the editor but will work in export projects when uploaded to Steam.  This seems to a limitation with Vulkan currently.
- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strongly recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.

Quick How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the GDExtension version of GodotSteam, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To GDExtension' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/gdextension/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam/releases) or [from the Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1972) and skip compiling it yourself!

Usage
----------
Do not use the GDExtension version of GodotSteam with any of the module versions whether it be our pre-compiled versions or ones you compile.  They are not compatible with each other.

When exporting with the GDExtension version, please use the normal Godot Engine templates instead of our GodotSteam templates or you will have a lot of issues.
